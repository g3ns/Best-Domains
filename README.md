# Best Domains
Ranking the best domain registrar and the worst.


### Porkbun
It's the best domain where it's really cheap and afffordable. They offer transfering domain to different account with no cost, and offer a lot about 500+ tlds.

**Domain Registar** : 4.5/5

**Web hosting**: 2/5

Overall: 3.5/5

It's not the best for web hosting since they keep on switching every month or so.

### Namecheap
It's kinda hard to manage different domains under the account, since they don't offer as much tlds. But they do got some good offers once in a while but it's difficlt with the ui.


**Domain Registar**: 3/5


**Web Hosting**: 2/5

Overall: 3/5


### IONOS

Cheap domains where you can get some on a discounted price, but it could be pricy if u wanna add more to it.


**Domian Registrar**: 3/5
**Web Hosting**: 1/5

Overall : 2/5


### GoDaddy:

They got some good domains  to register but you cou;dn't really do much on there. I wish there was a way to connect it with smtp or a way to uplload the files. Also it is really pricy for the web hosting.

**Domain Registrar**: 3/5
**Web Hosting**: 2/5

Overall: 2.5/5


## Nicenic

They are really bad you couldn't get it connected with cloudflare. Which you can with the other domains registrars. Which the support teams sucks really bad which they don't do much.

**Domain Registrar**: 1/5
**Web Hosting**:1/5

Overall: 1/5 they are so bad :-(
