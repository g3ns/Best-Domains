# Best Domains
Ranking the best domain registrar and the worst.

### Porkbun
It's the best domain where it's really cheap and afffordable. They offer transfering domain to different account with no cost, and offer a lot about 500+ tlds.

**Domain Registar** : 4.5/5

**Web hosting**: 2/5

Overall: 3.5/5

It's not the best for web hosting since they keep on switching every month or so.

### Namecheap
It's kinda hard to manage different domains under the account, since they don't offer as much tlds. But they do got some good offers once in a while but it's difficlt with the ui.


**Domain Registar**: 3/5
